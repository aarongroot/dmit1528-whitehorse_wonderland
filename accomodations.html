            <h3>Sundog Retreat</h3>
            <p>Nestled in the heart of the wilderness, Sundog retreat is the escape every adventurer is looking for.
                These 2 log cabins are built for the toughest winters Whitehorse is able to create.</p>

            <p>
                All amenities are included when you stay at sundog retreat including your very own Sauna! If you are
                being accompanied by your furry little friend, have no fear as our cabins are pet friendly.

                "We’ve got the best aurora-viewing site in northern Canada.

                You’ll enjoy the privacy of watching from your own cabin or central outdoor campfire.

                Your chances of seeing the northern lights during your stay are much higher than on a time-limited bus
                tour." ~ Sundog Retreats

            <h3>Yukon Black Spruce</h3>
            <p>"Black Spruce began in 2019 with the goal of creating a sustainable and beautiful place to stay in
                Whitehorse.</p>

            <p>
                The rocky property was considered essentially undevelopable, but by working with engineers and the city
                of Whitehorse, Black Spruce was able to situate the cabins in the landscape, creating a peaceful
                forested guest experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                The name is derived from the black local spruce shou sugi-ban siding that clads the cabins." ~ Yukon

            <h3>Sky High Wilderness</h3>
            <p>"Sky High Wilderness Ranch is located on the shore of Łu Zil Män (Fish Lake), 30 min from Whitehorse, and
                offers visitors the "Adventure of a lifetime". Whether it be dog sledding, a horseback adventure, or
                experiencing the "off-grid" lifestyle with one of our cabin and lodge stay packages, our wide range of
                thrilling adventures will satisfy even the most daring spirit.</p>

            <p>
                During winter, drive your own dog team in the mountains for a Half-Day or a Full-Day, spend the
                afternoon to learn about sled dogs, in the yard and around a campfire, or come for a week with the dogs
                on the trails, and chase the Northern Lights after daylight, on the ranch, or at camp. If you love
                nature and animals, you will find your way.

                In summer time, enjoy one of our "Off-grid" cabin and listen to the silence of Mother nature, ride your
                horse or hike in the mountains surrounding the lake, or join in for the dog training!" ~ Sky High
