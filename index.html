                    <p>"Black Spruce began in 2019 with the goal of creating a sustainable and beautiful place to stay
                        in
                        Whitehorse. The rocky property was considered essentially undevelopable, but by working with
                        engineers and
                        the city of Whitehorse, Black Spruce was able to situate the cabins in the landscape, creating a
                        peaceful
                        forested guest experience"~ Yukon Black Spruce

                    <p>
                        <!-- The name is derived from the black local spruce shou sugi-ban siding that clads the cabins." -->
                        These cabins are renown for their character and charm. What sets Black Spruce cabins apart is
                        the color of the siding.
                        Black spruce is such an apt name for these trees as the entire sidings of these cabins are
                        completely black! This allows for the warmest cabins available.
                        You will never be cold from Whitehorse winters as these cabins are able to hold so much heat
                        from the beatiful Whitehorse sun.
